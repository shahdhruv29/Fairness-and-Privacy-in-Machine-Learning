# Trustworthy AI: Fairness and Privacy in Machine Learning

In this repository, we discuss fairness and differential privacy in machine learning systems and explore literature at the intersection of these areas. We also reviewed literature related to auditing fairness and differential privacy in machine learning systems. Here we attempt to provide a comprehensive review of the work done.

*Note: This work was done as part of my B.Tech Project under the guidance of Prof. Rachit Chhaya and Prof. Manisha Padala. This repository is a work in progress.*
