# Fairness and Privacy in Machine Learning

We begin by studying fairness notions in machine learning, referring to [FairML]. Here, we get introduced to the existing notions of fairness and some sociotechnical contexts in which they are used. We also review the basics of Differential Privacy introduced by [Dwork *et al.*] and then move forward to learn about Differential Privacy in Machine Learning, referring to the in-depth literature review on the subject given by the book [DPML]. Next, we review the literature at the intersection of fairness and differential privacy, particularly the survey by [Fioretto *et al.*]. Next, we present some interesting research done in the intersection of these areas and attempt to identify potential research questions. 

## Differential Privacy and Fairness

There has been a lot of recent work in this domain, with many interesting research questions. I will describe some of the papers we reviewed in this domain and discuss some interesting questions answered in these works. 

First, we review the survey by [Fioretto *et al.*]. This survey provides a precise technical understanding of the problems of analysing a privacy-preserving machine learning system under a fairness lens. The survey focuses on two types of privacy-preserving machine learning setups, namely *Decision Tasks* and *Learning Tasks*, and provides detailed theoretical references and empirical proofs on how differential privacy can affect the fairness of the system.
