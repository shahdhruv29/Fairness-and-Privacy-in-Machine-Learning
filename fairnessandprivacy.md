# Fairness and Privacy in Machine Learning

We begin by studying fairness notions in machine learning, referring to [FairML]. Here, we get introduced to the existing notions of fairness and some sociotechnical contexts in which they are used. We also review the basics of Differential Privacy introduced by [Dwork *et al.*] and then move forward to learn about Differential Privacy in Machine Learning, referring to the in-depth literature review on the subject given by the book [DPML]. Next, we review the literature at the intersection of fairness and differential privacy, particularly the survey by [Fioretto *et al.*]. Next, we present some interesting research done in the intersection of these areas and attempt to identify potential research questions.
